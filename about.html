				<p>Hey, my name is Stacey and I've spent too much time reading the news recently. 
				</p>
				<p>So much so that I've gotten very motivate to help others. I've donated to charities in the hopes of making a difference but in the end I found that I was more connected to the rest of humanity than before. After spending some time thinking I decided that the best thing for me to do is volunteer when I can, where I can for the amount of time that I can. This will help me make a difference not only by supporting a worthy charity but by allowing me to see that I can make a difference and inspire others to do the same.

				<h2 class="h2-about"> Why Volunteering is Important</h2>
				<p> Another way to measure the impact of volunteers is to take a look at statistics like hours served and the economic value of volunteer time.According to the Corporation for National and Community Service, 61.8 million individuals in the United States contributed 8 billion hours of volunteerism in 2008 alone.The economic value of all this volunteering? $162 billion U.S. dollars. </p> 
				<p>To put that in context, this is roughly equivalent to the 2008 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Egypt. And that's just U.S. volunteers (to check out your country's stats, click here)! Volunteers are critical partners of and participants in societies throughout the world. Whether actively giving their time through a formal or ad hoc organizations, or taking part in what is sometimes called "informal volunteering" where citizens voluntarily participate in community activities or provide personal care for family, friends, neighbors, or even strangers as part of accepted cultural norms of giving and reciprocity.
