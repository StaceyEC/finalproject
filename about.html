				<div class="row clearfix">
					<p>Hey, my name is Stacey and I've spent too much time reading the news recently.So much so that it reenvigorated my desire to help others. I've always wanted to get more involved in charties and volunteer organizations but I felt like I was too busy to do anything, so I would donate my time instead. While I found some meaning in this, I didn't feel like I was doing enough.
					</p> 
					<p>
					After spending some time thinking I decided that the best thing for me to do is volunteer when I can, where I can, for the amount of time that I can . This will help me make a difference not only by supporting a worthy charity but by allowing me to see that I can make a difference and inspire others to do the same.

					<h2 class="h2-about"> Why Volunteering is Important</h2>
					<p> Another way to measure the impact of volunteers is to take a look at statistics like hours served and the economic value of volunteer time.According to the Corporation for National and Community Service, 61.8 million individuals in the United States contributed 8 billion hours of volunteerism in 2008 alone.The economic value of all this volunteering? $162 billion U.S. dollars. </p> 
					<p>To put that in context, this is roughly equivalent to the 2008 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Egypt. And that's just U.S. volunteers (to check out your country's stats, click here)! Volunteers are critical partners of and participants in societies throughout the world. Whether actively giving their time through a formal or ad hoc organizations, or taking part in what is sometimes called "informal volunteering" where citizens voluntarily participate in community activities or provide personal care for family, friends, neighbors, or even strangers as part of accepted cultural norms of giving and reciprocity.

					<h2 class="h2-about"> Want to Just Donate?</h2>
					<p> I hope that this project will evolve to include a charity locator as well, but there are some pretty good ones out there. <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/" class="a-inline"> Check out this amazing charity resource</a>. 

					Or, you can just donate to <a href="https://www.whitehelmets.org/en" class="a-inline"> my favorite charity, The White Helmets</a>. They are doing heroic things in a very troubled part of the world with no support. These are just loving, giving individuals trying to make a difference in their war-torn country. If there's ever a charity that deserved a donation it's this one.
