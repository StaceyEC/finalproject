			<h2>The Location-Based Charity Finder</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<p>Hey, my name is Stacey and I've spent too much time reading the news recently. 
				</p>
				<p>So much so that I've gotten very motivate to help others. I've donated to charities in the hopes of making a difference but in the end I found that I was more connected to the rest of humanity than before. After spending some time thinking I decided that the best thing for me to do is volunteer when I can, where I can for the amount of time that I can. This will help me make a difference not only by supporting a worthy charity but by allowing me to see that I can make a difference and inspire others to do the same.
