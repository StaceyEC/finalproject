# Volunteer Match based Map

This webapp, which will be mobile based, allows people to input an address. From that address, it will search [VolunteerMatch.org](https://volunteermatch.org)
for all available volunteer opportunities that are upcoming.

These search results will be rendered on a google map as pins with more information about each opportunity.

## How this will work

1. User navigates to site
2. User inputs address
3. Runs [script written by Taq](http://staceyfewd113.webscript.io/volunteermatch?l=Astoria%20Queens%20nyc) to pull in latest volunteer opps
4. processes each item and puts into google maps
5. displays

## Technologies needed

1. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) / [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) / SemanticUI(http://semantic-ui.com/)
2. [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-simple)
